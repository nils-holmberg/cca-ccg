What would be your vision for the communities and the people that he's done also what would be your vision for the land and landscape families or the environment that are in land and water? I don't want to sacrifice one for the sake of the other. I don't want you to walk away here thinking that I want to sacrifice our land, our environment, our resources for the sake of an unaffordable house that college graduate can afford. I don't think that we need to sacrifice one for the other. I think there has to be a balance because we do have, I don't know of any other area that you can go and you can see as much wetlands, the marsh, the primary nursery areas that we have. I don't think that we need to sacrifice that for the sake of the land.
